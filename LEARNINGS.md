# Nonobench: method learnings

The moments that changed how Nonobench measures models. This is not a
changelog. Each entry records what we assumed, what the data showed, what we
changed, and what remains open. Together they are the caveats and design
decisions a write-up of the benchmark would need to flag and explain.

Numbers refer to the Standard set (30 core puzzles: ten each of 5x5, 10x10
and 15x15) unless noted. Hard mode is the 20x20 tier.

---

## 1. Correct answers are not unique: grade against the clues

**Assumed.** Each puzzle has one solution, so an answer is correct when it
matches the stored grid.

**Saw.** Ten of the 30 core puzzles admit more than one grid that satisfies
every row and column clue. Exact matching marked valid answers as wrong. A
forensic pass over every stored answer also found valid grids that the parser
missed when a model restated its grid several times while reasoning.

**Changed (V1.2).** An answer is correct when it satisfies every clue. When a
text answer contains several grids, the last complete grid counts. A regrade
of all historical runs moved 43 answers from wrong to right and none the
other way. The database keeps each run's original `correct` flag as history.
The exports regrade every stored answer with the current grader, so the
site, API and exported files are the reference.

**Open.** Puzzles with several solutions are slightly easier, since more
grids count as correct. A uniqueness-checked puzzle set removes this; Hard
mode is uniqueness-checked with an exact solver.

## 2. "The same model" is not the same model on every endpoint

**Assumed.** A model ID on OpenRouter is one model.

**Saw.** Six open-weight families had been served by third-party resellers
running fp4/fp8 quantizations, not by their own lab. Even first-party
endpoints differ: Moonshot serves Kimi at mxfp4.

**Changed (V1.2).** Every model is pinned to its lab's first-party endpoint
with fallbacks disabled. Provider and quantization are recorded for every
run, and results from the earlier endpoints were rerun.

**Open.** Results measure a model *as served*, including the lab's own
quantization and serving choices. Reproducing a result needs the provider,
not just the model name.

## 3. Output mode is not neutral

**Assumed.** Structured output (a JSON schema) only removes parsing noise.

**Saw.** For some models, forcing the schema changed behaviour. On a 5x5
comparison, Qwen 3.8 Max, Qwen 3.8 Flash, Mistral Medium 3.5 and Claude
Fable 5.1 did clearly better in plain text. Kimi K3 on its first-party
endpoint went from 0/10 with the schema to 10/10 in text, with similar
reasoning length, so the schema itself broke it. Some first-party endpoints
(DeepSeek, GLM) do not support structured output at all.

**Changed.** Structured output is the default. A model moves to text mode
when its lab's endpoint lacks it, or when a 5x5 comparison shows a clear
gap. A 0/10 result on 5x5 stops a run automatically as a likely format
problem rather than recording it as a score.

**Open.** Choosing the output mode per model on benchmark puzzles is a form
of tuning. It is done on 5x5, the easiest tier, and disclosed, but it is a
researcher degree of freedom.

## 4. The answer format itself stops scaling: counting fails before logic

**Assumed.** A flat string of width x height `0`/`1` characters works at any
size, because it works at 5x5.

**Saw.** The share of answers with the wrong number of cells grows with grid
size. For the same seven strong models: 12/70 answers at 10x10 (100 cells),
31/70 at 15x15 (225), 45/70 at 20x20 (400). On the first Hard-mode run,
81 of about 100 answers had the wrong length. GPT-6 Sol and Claude Fable 5.1
got the length wrong on all ten puzzles; only Gemini 3.8 Flash and GPT-6
Astra mostly got it right. Some models also reasoned far less on 20x20 than
on 15x15 (Claude Opus 5.5 about 1–2k reasoning tokens vs 8.5k), which
suggests sketching the picture rather than solving it.

**Why (literature).** This is the failure the tokenization literature
predicts. Long runs of a repeated character are split into irregular
multi-character tokens, and counting them breaks down within tens of
characters. Separators between items improve counting by 13–40 points
([Counting Ability of LLMs and Impact of Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.19730v2)).
Models can also hold the right count internally and still emit the wrong
one ([Repeated-Token Counting](https://arxiv.org/html/2605.09239v1)).
Common grid formats are row by row:
- ARC-AGI stores every grid as a list of rows.
- The webpbn nonogram format stores one string per row.
- Rosetta Code's nonogram solver prints one row per line.

We found no published nonogram benchmark that compares a flat string with
rows directly. VGRP-Bench, which includes nonograms, reports format failures
as a major problem even with 2D JSON arrays
([VGRP-Bench](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.23064v2)).

**Tested.** Hard mode was paused after about $14 of runs and the same three
models were rerun with one row per line (structured output: an array of row
strings):

| Model | 20x20 flat | 20x20 rows |
|---|---|---|
| GPT-6 Sol high | 0/10 | 10/10 |
| Claude Opus 5.5 high | 2/10 | 10/10 |
| Claude Fable 5.1 high | 0/10 | 7/10 |

At 15x15 the same change made no difference (separate experiment database,
four models): 23/40 solved with the flat string, 21/40 with rows. Per model:
- Claude Opus 5.5: 8 → 7
- GPT-6 Sol: 7 → 4
- Gemini 3.8 Flash: 5 → 5
- DeepSeek V4.1 Flash: 3 → 5

Per puzzle, the picture is mixed:
- Of the 14 answers with the wrong number of cells in the flat format, four
  became solves with rows. Examples: Claude Opus 5.5 on puzzle 28 (219 cells
  instead of 225 on an easy puzzle), and DeepSeek V4.1 Flash on 28 and 29.
  Those were counting failures.
- Four of Gemini's wrong-size answers became complete but wrong grids, so
  the miscount was hiding a wrong solution.
- Other puzzles flipped both ways for reasons unrelated to format. GPT-6 Sol
  gave up on three puzzles in rows that it had solved flat.

The net totals match within single-run noise. The format costs individual
answers at 15x15, but a single attempt per puzzle adds more noise than the
format does.

**Changed.** Hard mode asks for one row per line. Standard keeps the flat
string: it is not the bottleneck at 15x15, and changing it would break
comparability with every earlier run.

**Open.** A wrong-length answer can be a counting failure or a model that is
lost on the logic; the answer alone doesn't say which. Standard also carries
this effect (31/70 at 15x15). It applies equally to every version, so
comparisons stay fair, but scores partly measure output bookkeeping. Changing
the format for Standard would break comparability with all earlier runs.

## 5. Bigger is not harder: difficulty needs its own measure

**Assumed.** 20x20 is harder than 15x15.

**Saw.** Gemini 3.8 Flash solved 8/10 of the first 20x20s but 5/10 of the
15x15s. The generated 20x20s are picture-like, with long filled runs, and
the easier ones fall to row-by-row logic. Two of the 15x15s need more than
line logic.

**Changed.** Hard mode mixes five line-solvable 20x20s with five unique
puzzles that line logic alone can't solve, checked by an exact solver.
Difficulty is described by line-solvability and how far line propagation
gets, not by size.

**Then saw.** With the row format, GPT-6 Sol and Claude Opus 5.5 solved all
ten Hard-mode puzzles, including the five that line logic alone can't solve.
Opus solved one of those with 459 reasoning tokens, far too few to deduce a
20x20 grid. The generator draws smooth, symmetric, picture-like shapes, and a
model can complete the picture instead of solving the clues. Uniqueness and
"not line-solvable" are necessary for a hard puzzle, but they are not
enough: the picture must not give the answer away. The noisier 15x15s stay
much harder (Sol 7/10, Opus 8/10).

**Changed.** Hard mode was regenerated from random fills: about 5 blocks per
line, mirror symmetry near 50%, all unique. Five puzzles are line-solvable
and five stall line logic with 28–174 cells left. On this set:

| Variant | Solved | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Opus 5.5 high | 8/10 | all five deep puzzles |
| GPT-6 Astra xhigh | 5/10 | all five line-solvable, none of the deep ones |
| Claude Fable 5.1 high | 5/10 | |
| 11 other families | 0/10 | |

The other families mostly ran out of the 128k budget, gave up with "no
solution", or returned a wrong or malformed grid; Muse Spark hit Meta's
5-minute limit on every puzzle. The tier now separates the frontier, and
it measures the difference between line logic and deeper search.

**Then saw.** Foote and Krizanc also generate nonograms from random fills in
"Nonogram: Complexity of Inference and Phase Transition Behavior" (2025,
https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07283), trying different probabilities for a
cell to be filled. Krizanc confirmed by email (28 Sep 2026) that a
probability of 0.5, which leaves about half the grid filled, fell in the
hard region. Hard mode's grids are 49–60% filled, so they sit in that
region.

**Open.** Hard puzzles need low visual regularity as well as logical depth.
Random fills near 50% density give both. A principled difficulty scale
(search depth, branching needed) would make tiers comparable.

## 6. Provider limits become scores unless handled explicitly

**Saw.** Meta ends Muse Spark requests at 5 minutes, confirmed from the
provider's own activity data. Long reasoning on large grids hits that limit.

**Changed.** A request that dies at a documented provider limit is recorded
as a `timeout`: final and unsolved, never retried. A timeout needs evidence:
a connection-drop or timeout error near the documented cutoff. Anything else
is a retryable failure. Variants with timeouts are labelled "incomplete".
Retries are only ever for API errors, never for wrong answers.

**Open.** Timeouts penalise slow-but-careful reasoning on that provider. The
score measures the model *under its provider's limits*.

## 7. Guards must be per model, not per answer

**Saw.** An early guard re-ran individual answers that came back with zero
reasoning tokens. That is cherry-picking: it retries until the answer looks
like reasoning happened.

**Changed.** A zero-reasoning check trips per model (a circuit breaker) and
stops that model; it never re-rolls single answers.

## 8. "Best level" flatters families with more levels

**Saw.** Effort ladders are noisy and not monotonic: Claude Opus 5.5 scored
28/30 at high but 25 at xhigh and 26 at max; GPT-6 Sol 26 at high and 25 at
max. Picking each family's best of several noisy single-run measurements
favours families with more levels (winner's curse).

**Changed.** The leaderboard says "best observed level", shows every level on
the effort ladder, and lists this under Limitations.

**Open.** Fairer options: pick the level on a held-out set, or report a fixed
level per family (e.g. the provider's default).

## 9. The Standard set saturates at the top

**Saw.** GPT-6 Astra xhigh solved 30/30; Astra high 29 and Opus 5.5 high 28.
With one attempt per puzzle, the 95% ranges of the top models overlap
almost entirely.

**Implication.** Standard no longer separates the frontier. That is the
reason for Hard mode, and why its answer format (section 4) has to be right.

## 10. Output budgets are part of the method

**Assumed.** A model's answer ends when the model is done.

**Saw.** No output limit was set, so every provider's default applied:
65,536 tokens for Anthropic, OpenAI, Qwen and Meta, and 131,072 for
DeepSeek, GLM and Kimi. On Standard, 105 answers across 28 variants were
cut off mid-reasoning (`finish_reason: length`) and scored wrong. On the
random Hard-mode pilot, 4 of Claude Opus 5.5's 6 misses were cut off at
65,536 tokens.

**Changed.** Hard mode gives every request the same 128,000-token budget,
capped at the endpoint's own maximum (Gemini 3.8 Flash: 65,536). The Opus
answers cut off in the pilot were rerun under that budget; answers that
finished below the old limit are unaffected by it. Standard keeps the
provider defaults and lists them under Limitations.

**Then saw.** More effort can mean fewer solves under a fixed budget. On
Hard mode, Claude Fable 5.1 solved 5/10 at high (2 cut off) but 1/10 at
xhigh, with 6 of its 9 misses cut off at 128,000 tokens. At a fixed budget,
extra effort helps only when the model can finish inside it.

**Open.** Whether to rerun Standard's cut-off answers under the same budget.
Needing more than 65k tokens is itself a result about efficiency, but the
limit differed by provider.

## 11. The prompt is part of the method: version it

**Saw.** The prompt gained the line "if there is no solution, output 0"
partway through the original January session; 747 early runs used the
earlier wording.

**Changed.** Every variant carries a version (1.0 January, 1.1 February–March,
1.2 September). An immutable attempt log records every API attempt with the
code revision, provider, output mode and raw output.

---

## 12. "Solved" hides how a model misses

**Assumed.** A miss is a wrong grid, and a binary score says enough.

**Saw.** Breaking down the misses of 14 current models on the ten 15x15s
(best observed level each), only 2 of about 70 misses were complete grids
that broke some clues. The rest were:
- answers with the wrong number of cells;
- "no solution" give-ups;
- answers cut off by the output limit;
- empty answers.

Each model misses in its own way:
- Grok 4.7 gives up (4 of 10).
- Gemini 3.8 Flash miscounts (5 of 10).
- Muse Spark 1.3 and Claude Fable 5.1 run out of tokens (6 and 3 of 10).

Where models do return full grids, as in Hard mode with the row format, the
distance to the solution separates them further:
- Claude Opus 5.5 missed by 2 cells (twice) and GPT-6 Astra by 1.
- Gemini 3.8 Flash's grids had 33% of the 400 cells wrong.
- Qwen 3.8 Max's grids had 45% wrong, close to chance on puzzles that are
  about half filled.

**Changed.** "Solved" stays the headline. Beside it:
- a per-model breakdown of how misses happen;
- for complete wrong grids, the cells off and the share of clue lines
  satisfied. "Cells off" only applies to puzzles with a single solution;
  "lines satisfied" works everywhere.

"Wrong size" is labelled as miscounted cells: section 4 shows some of these
are formatting slips, not logic failures.

## 13. One attempt per puzzle is the largest source of noise

**Saw.** In the 15x15 flat vs rows experiment (section 4), puzzles flipped
between solved, gave up, cut off and wrong for reasons unrelated to the
format. GPT-6 Sol gave up on three puzzles in one run that it solved in the
other. Opus 5.5 solved puzzle 24 flat and returned a wrong grid for it in
rows. The effort ladders are not monotonic either (section 8), and the 95%
ranges at n = 30 span about 30 points in the middle of the scale.

**Open.** Repeated attempts per puzzle (e.g. three, reporting the mean or the
share of puzzles solved at least once) would show whether a single miss is
bad luck or a pattern. They would also tighten the ranges and make the
format and effort-level comparisons measurable. The cost is about three
times as much per variant: a candidate for a V2.0 Standard.

## 14. An effort level on OpenRouter may not be a level the model has

**Assumed.** The levels in OpenRouter's `supported_efforts` are the levels
the model has, so `bench/refresh-effort-levels.ts` builds each ladder from
that list.

**Saw.** Qwen documents three `reasoning_effort` levels for Qwen3.8-Max: low,
medium and xhigh (default). OpenRouter lists five for
`qwen/qwen3.8-max-0902` (minimal to xhigh), and its docs say an unsupported
level maps "to the nearest supported level". Nothing in the API says which
native level a request got: the endpoint's `reasoning` is null and the
generation record only reports tokens. Our runs fall into three token
groups, which fits minimal → low and high → xhigh:

| Sent | Avg tokens 5x5 / 10x10 / 15x15 | Solved |
|---|---|---|
| minimal | 3.1k / 36.7k / 39.9k | 18/30 |
| low | 3.1k / 34.4k / 45.1k | 18/30 |
| medium | 4.2k / 38.5k / 38.3k | 14/30 |
| high | 4.7k / 30.1k / 55.9k | 18/30 |
| xhigh | 5.6k / 32.6k / 58.6k | 18/30 |

A Reddit reader asked why "Best" showed Qwen3.8 Max at minimal. It was the
cheapest of four levels tied at 18/30, and was most likely Qwen's low.

**Implication.** The pairs are an accidental repeat: the same native setting
twice gave the same total with different per-size splits (low: 10x10 7 vs 8,
15x15 1 vs 0), which is section 13's noise, measured.

**Open.** Confirm the mapping with OpenRouter. Before running an effort
ladder, check `supported_efforts` against the lab's own docs, and only run
native levels (or label mapped ones on the site). Audit the other families
for the same gap.

## Measurement notes

- **Single attempt per puzzle.** n = 30 per Standard score; the Wilson 95%
  range is about ±15 points in the middle of the scale. Repeats would
  tighten it at proportional cost.
- **Cost and time are as served.** Both are measured through OpenRouter and
  include provider speed and pricing, not just the model.
