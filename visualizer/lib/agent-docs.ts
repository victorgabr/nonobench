No authentication. Everything is read-only.

- REST API: \`${SITE_URL}/api/v1\`. OpenAPI spec: ${SITE_URL}/api/openapi.json
  - \`GET /api/v1/leaderboard?size=10x10&provider=openai&effort=best&version=1.2\`: models ranked by accuracy, with shared ranks for equal displayed scores. Filters: \`provider\`, \`family\` (comma-separated ids), \`version\` (comma-separated 1.0, 1.1, 1.2), \`effort\` (best, all, or a level), \`reasoning\` and \`open_weights\` (true/false), \`size\`, \`min_correct\` (non-negative integer). API defaults: effort all, min_correct 0 (includes variants that solved none). Use \`min_correct=1\` to hide them. Leaderboard and model responses include \`version\`.
  - Empty \`provider\`, \`family\`, or \`version\` values mean no filter; spaces around comma-separated ids are ignored. Empty \`effort\` means all. Unknown open-weight status is excluded by both weights filters.
  - \`GET /api/v1/providers\`: provider ids, names and families
  - \`GET /api/v1/families\`: family ids, display names, efforts and best variants
  - \`POST /api/v1/compare\` with \`{"models":["Claude Sonnet 4.5","GLM 5"]}\`: compare family-best variants or exact variant ids
  - \`GET /api/v1/models/{model}\`: one model, per grid size (accuracy, cost, latency, tokens)
  - \`GET /api/v1/models/{model}/puzzles\`: outcomes for all 40 puzzles, including which were solved
  - \`GET /api/v1/puzzles?size=5x5\`: the puzzles with ids and clues
  - \`GET /api/v1/puzzles/{id}?include_solution=true\`: one puzzle and the exact prompt text
  - \`GET /api/v1/puzzles/{id}/results?family=gpt-6-sol&effort=best&include_answers=true\`: per-model outcomes; filters match the leaderboard and answers are opt-in
  - \`POST /api/v1/puzzles/{id}/check\` with \`{"grid": "0110..."}\`: check a grid against the clues
  - \`GET /api/v1/runs?model=&puzzle=&size=&include_output=true&limit=100&offset=0\`: individual runs
- MCP server (Streamable HTTP, stateless): \`${SITE_URL}/mcp\`. Tools: get_leaderboard, list_providers, list_families, compare_models, get_model_results, get_model_puzzles, list_puzzles, get_puzzle, get_puzzle_results, check_solution, list_runs

const METHOD = `## Method

Each model gets the same system prompt and a puzzle's row and column clues, and must answer with the filled grid. An answer is correct when it satisfies every row and column clue; some puzzles have more than one valid solution. There are 40 puzzles in two tiers:

- Standard: 10 each of 5x5, 10x10 and 15x15. Answers are one string of \`1\` (filled) and \`0\` (empty), row by row. Overall accuracy covers these 30 puzzles.
- Hard mode: 10 random 20x20 puzzles, each with a single solution. Answers are written one row per line. Each family runs it at its best Standard effort level, and its results stay separate from the overall score. Query it with \`size=20x20\`.`;

## Tips

- Prefer the MCP server when your client supports it; otherwise use the REST API.
- The site defaults to each family's best observed level; the REST and MCP leaderboard default to all variants for existing callers. Set \`effort=best\` to match the site.
- Versions mark when a variant was first measured: V1.0 January 2026, V1.1 February–March, V1.2 September. Older exports without \`version\` use \`legacy=false\` for V1.2 and otherwise V1.0; V1.1 becomes distinguishable when the export includes the field.
- On Standard, the site hides variants that solved no puzzles; the Hard mode tab shows every variant that ran it. REST and MCP include them by default; set \`min_correct=1\` to match Standard.
- With \`size=20x20\`, \`effort=best\` picks each family's best Hard mode result, not its best Standard level.
- An effort value of \`default\` means reasoning is on but the model has no adjustable reasoning levels.
- Model names are ids such as \`gpt-5.4-xhigh\`; the suffix is the reasoning effort. Get the full list from the leaderboard.
- Accuracy is a percentage (0-100). Costs are in USD, as billed through OpenRouter.
- Don't request \`include_output\` unless you need raw model outputs; they are large.
